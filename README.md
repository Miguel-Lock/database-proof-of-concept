# Database Proof of Concept

Sample database for the Franciscan University Pub.

Database design requirements:

1. Select a DB real-life application
2. Design a DB schema with at least 7 different tables
3. Primary keys must be declared wherever possible
4. Foreign keys must be declared whenever one table depends on antoher in some way
5. Must define at least 10 integrity constraints aside from primary and foreign key constraints
6. Must have at least 3 user roles, aside from DB admin role
7. No two users may have the same priveleges, though one may have privileges that are a subset of those of another user
8. At least 3 tables must have at least 20 tuples instanciated
9. Must have at least 3 views defined
10. Create a C++ application that interfaces with the database. Full functionality not required, just proof of concept
